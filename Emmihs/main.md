<h1>THE HABITAT</h1>

The Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation base, or Hi-SEAS, is located on the Northside of Mauna Loa, on the saddle between two of the tallest volcanoes of the world, on the Big Island of Hawai'i. At an elevation of over 2500m above sea level, it is equipped with a fitting analogue for the desolated Lunar surface, as well as a comparable psychological remoteness from the rest of our home planet. The direct surroundings of the habitat is an abandoned quarry, where field tests and Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) can be conducted in a fitting geological Mars-like environment.

<h1>THE MISSION</h1>

After serving for long-duration missions in collaboration with NASA, Hi-SEAS now continues with providing high-end research for shorter duration missions. With a quick succession of a wide variety of leading and future experts, the current mission of Hi-SEAS includes two goals: Developing new technologies for future extraterrestrial habitats, and training those who might be potential founders of such habitats

<h1>THE CREW</h1>

The crew of the EMMIHS campaigns are carefully selected to make for a close-knit group with a wide array in backgrounds. These interdisciplinary backgrounds help us create new insights for the technological advancements we want to achieve during our simulation mission. Besides aiding each other in the necessary fields to bring the simulation to a succes, this gives us the opportunity to spread our knowledge within and outside of the habitat.
