I"Ó<p>Founded by the International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG), as part of research efforts towards the colonization of Moon and eventually the colonization of Mars, the EuroMoonMars initiative comprises of field campaigns in Moon-Mars analogue environments.</p>

<p>These field campaigns have been organised in specific locations of technical, scientific and exploration interest. The campaigns started with EuroGeoMars2009 (Utah MDRS, 24 Jan-1 Mar 2009) with ILEWG, ESA ESTEC, NASA Ames, VU Amsterdam and GWU.</p>

<h2>EMMIHS Campaigns</h2>

<p>Currently, ILEWG is collaborating with the International Moonbase Alliance (IMA) and the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) on a series of EuroMoonMars, IMA and HI-SEAS (EMMIHS) campaigns, at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) analogue facilities.</p>

<p>Located at 8,200â€™ (2,500 meters) in elevation, HI-SEAS has been organising regular simulated missions to the Moon, Mars or other planetary bodies. The EMMIHS campaigns consist of research activities for data analysis, instruments tests and development, field tests in Moon-Mars analogues, pilot projects, training and hands-on workshops and outreach activities.</p>

<h2>EMM IgLuna 2019 Campaign</h2>

<p>IgLuna is the first ESA Lab inter-University demonstrator project, and is hosted by the Swiss Space Centre (SSC) with the vision to create an analogue habitat inside lunar ice caps. The campaigns were held from 17â€“30 June 2019 and involved 18 student teams from 9 countries across Europe. The students developed modular demonstrators and tested them during a field test conducted inside the moon-like extreme environment of the Glacier Palace inside the Matterhorn glacier.</p>
