I"u	<h1>ArtMoonMars, Moon Village &amp; ITACCUS</h1>
<p>The Moon Village is an open concept proposed with the goal of a sustainable human and robotic presence on the lunar surface as an ensemble where multiple users can carry out multiple activities. We want to involve everybody including Socio cultural and Artistic aspects.</p>

<h2>Why ArtMoonMars?</h2>
<p>Artists can convey multiple messages of the community including planetary science, life sciences, astronomy, fundamental research, resources utilisation, human spaceflight, peaceful cooperation, economical development, inspiration, training &amp; capacity building.</p>

<h1>Moon Gallery Project</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.moongallery.eu/">Moon Gallery</a> is an international collaborative artwork and a gallery of ideas worth sending to the Moon. Moon Gallery aims to set up the first permanent museum on the Moon. Moon Gallery will launch 100 artefacts to the Moon within the compact format of 10 x 10 x 1cm plate on a lunar lander exterior panelling as early as 2022. In this Petri-dish-like gallery, we are developing a culture for future interplanetary society. What are the ideas we want to promote into the future? What are the ideas we want to leave behind?</p>

<p>We suggest bringing this collection of ideas as the seeds of a new culture. We believe that culture makes a distinction between mere survival and life. Moon Gallery is a symbolic gesture that has a real inﬂuence – a way to reboot culture, rethink our values for better living on Earth planet.</p>

<p>We hope to bring the best of humanity to the Moon and to bring the benefits of the Moon to all people on Earth through a sustainable exploration process. Our initiatives connect Art, Moon, Mars and beyond. This includes the organisation of meetings, workshops, art-science-space classes and projects at various universities, sessions at international conferences, art exhibitions, musical and visual performances.</p>
